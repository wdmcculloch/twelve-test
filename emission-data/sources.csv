Objectives/ data type/ Methodology","Climate Watch Historical Emission data contains sector-level greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions data for 194 countries and the European Union (EU) for the period 1990-2018, including emissions of the six major GHGs from most major sources and sinks.  Non-CO2 emissions are expressed in CO2 equivalents using 100-year global warming potential values from IPCC Fourth Assessment Report."
